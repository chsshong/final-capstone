# Suicide Among Veterans Powerpoint
## Introduction
Suicide is a major problem in both the general population and the military community.

Just from our unit, there were 4 suicides in the past year.

Suicide is preventable yet sadly, it is the second-leading cause of death for post-9/11 veterans.

To inform the magnitude of this issue and bring awareness of the problems facing in the military organization, I will be performing an analysis 
of the national veteran suicide data (from 2001-2019) published by the department of veteran affairs.

## Data Cleaning
Data source: (https://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/suicide_prevention/data.asp)

Raw Data: 2001â€“2019-National-Suicide-Data-Appendix_508.xlsx

The National dataset contains data collected from 2001-2019 into 4 category tabs: 

"Categories": Veteran, Non-Veteran, U.S. Adult Population, Former Guard and Reserve. 

Within each tab, there are 2 sets of data: 

"Category" Deaths by Suicide: Crude and Adjusted Rates by Sex, 2001-2019		

"Category" Deaths by Suicide: Rates by Sex and Age Group, 2001-2019													

Since the two sets of data had different length of rows, I created dataset for each and cominbed the 3 categories (Veteran, Non-Veteran, U.S. Adult Popultation) and converted it into csv file.

### Info on dataset 2001-2019-National-Data:

Total of 19 rows and 40 columns. 0 nan and null values.

I will be using only the following columns:
